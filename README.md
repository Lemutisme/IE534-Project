## Project Explaination

For over a hundred years, everyone has wanted to move to California. California is by far the most populous and economically developed state in the United States. Whether it's tech, art, science, or cooking, by the turn of the century, the "Golden State" looks set to be the global center from north to south, and it seems like the best place in America to start over.

Naturally, California became the top destination for UIUC freshmen, and many were lured by the allure of the Golden State and decided to give up everything and go to Silicon Valley to find new jobs. However, it's one thing to have a steady job before making such a move, and it's another to have a backup set of jobs in case anything goes wrong with the current job.

The purpose of our group's project is to use data to predict California's employment rate over the next decade. Such predictions could be useful to future Californians, California lawmakers, or California citizens looking to leave or stay in the state. We might use some new feature engineering and use many different models to make predictions on employment data.
